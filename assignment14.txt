“Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds. 
Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” 
That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. 
“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. 
They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. 
That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” – Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird
Q.1- Write a Python program to read last n lines of a file

Sol:-import sys
import os
def file_read_from_tail(fname,lines):
        bufsize = 8192
        fsize = os.stat(fname).st_size
        iter = 0
        with open(fname) as f:
                if bufsize > fsize:
                        bufsize = fsize-1
                        data = []
                        while True:
                                iter +=1
                                f.seek(fsize-bufsize*iter)
                                data.extend(f.readlines())
                                if len(data) >= lines or f.tell() == 0:
                                        print(''.join(data[-lines:]))
                                        break

file_read_from_tail('acad.txt',2)


 Q.2- Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a file.

Sol:-from collections import Counter
def word_count(fname):
        with open(fname) as f:
                return Counter(f.read().split())

print("Number of words in the file :",word_count("acad.txt"))

Q.3- Write a Python program to copy the contents of a file to another file.
SOl:-
from shutil import copyfile
copyfile('temp.py', '3.py')
