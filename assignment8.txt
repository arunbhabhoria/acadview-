Q.1- What is Time Tuple?
sol:- 1) The timetuple() method of datetime.date instances returns an object of type time.struct_time. 
     2) The struct_time is a named tuple object (A named tuple object has attributes that can be accessed by an index or by name).
     3) The struct_time object has attributes for representing both date and time fields along with a flag to indicate whether Daylight Saving Time is active.
example:-
	import datetime
  	todaysDate = datetime.date.today()
	timeTuple = todaysDate.timetuple()
	print(timeTuple)
	print(timeTuple.tm_year)

Q2.Write a program to get formatted time.

sol:-import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print ("Current date and time : ")
print (now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

Q3. Extract month from the time.

sol:-
	import datetime
	d=datetime.datetime.now()
	print (d.month)

Q4. - Extract day from the time.

sol:- import datetime
      d=datetime.datetime.now()
      print(d.day)
Q6.Write a program to print time using localtime method.

sol:- 	import time
	t=time.localtime()
	print(t)
Q7.Find the factorial of a number input by user using math package functions.
sol:-import math
     x=int(input("enter number:"))
     m=math.factorial(x)
     print("factorial of ",x, "is:",m)

Q8.Find the GCD of a number input by user using math package functions.

sol:-   import math
	x=int(input("Enter 1st no:"))
	y=int(input("Enter 2nd no: "))
	m=math.gcd(x,y)
	print("\ngcd of",x,"and",y,"is: ",m)

Q9.Use OS package and do the following tasks: 
1. Get current working directory.
2. Get the user environment.

sol:-  1)- import os
	   os.getcwd()
output:-'C:\\Users\\arun\\.spyder-py3'

       2) import os
	   print(os.environ)
